The following file provides syntax highlighting for the Impex syntax. For further information, check out the [SAP Hybris Help Site].

## Installation

In order to install the Impex syntax highlighting, open up **Sublime Text 3** and go to *Preferences > Browse Packages...* . This will open a directory containing a **User** subfolder. 

Simply copy & paste the *impex* folder from this repository into the User directory. The changes are available immediately. Afterwards restart **Sublime Text 3** and the new syntax highlighting should be available whenever you open a file with an *\*.impex* or *\*.csv* extension.
