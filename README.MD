The following file provides syntax highlighting for the Impex syntax. For further information, check out the [SAP Commerce Cloud Help Site] (formerly known as SAP Hybris).

## Installation

In order to install the Impex syntax highlighting, open up **Sublime Text 3** and go to *Preferences > Browse Packages...* . This will open a directory containing a **User** subdirectory. 

Simply copy & paste the *impex* folder from this repository into the User directory. The changes are available immediately. Whenever you open a file with an `*.impex` or `.csv` extension, highlighting should now be available.
